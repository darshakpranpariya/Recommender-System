## Abstract 
A movie recommendation system project would typically involve the development of algorithms that can analyze a set of movies and then recommend new movies to users based on their previous preferences. The projectalso involved the development of a user interface that would allow users to easily browse and select movies. We haveimplemented a content-based filtering algorithm to recommend movies to users. This algorithm takes in a user's preferences as input and then recommends new movies that are like the ones that the user has already watched. Along with that, we have made a Hybrid recommendation system using GPT3 in which movies are going to be recommended based on the hybrid features.

## Introduction
With the proliferation of streaming services, there has been an increase in the number of movies and TV shows that are available to watch.This has led to the need for a better way to recommend movies and TV shows to viewers. 

In this project, we propose a movie recommender system that uses machine learning and the GPT-3 model to recommend movies to users. The GPT-3 model is a transformer-based language model that is trained on a large amount of text data. The model cangeneratetext that is likethe training data. We can use this property of the GPT-3 model to generate movie recommendations. 

We evaluate our movie recommender system on the TMDB moviesdataset. The TMDB movies dataset is a collection of movie ratings from users. We use the ratings from the TMDB movies dataset to train and test our movie recommender system. We find that our movie recommender systemoutperformsother recommender systems that use the TMDB movies dataset. We also find that our movie recommender systemperforms better than another recommender system.

## Methods
Steps we have followed,

1) First, we need to gather data about movies. This can be done by scraping movie data from websites such as TMDB or Rotten Tomatoes.
2) Once we have gathered the data, we need to clean it up and format it in a way that can be used by our machine learning algorithm.
3) Next, we need to split the data into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train our machine learning algorithm, while the testset will be used to evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm.
4) Once the data is prepared, we can start training our machine learning algorithm. We will use the cosine similarity matrix to find similar movies.
5) The sixth step is to improve the system by adding more movies to the dataset and using different methods to recommend movies to the user.
6) Finally, we haveusedthe gpt3 algorithm to recommend movies to users.
7) The seventh and final step is to deploy the system and make it available to the users.
