## Abstract 
A movie recommendation system project would typically involve the development of algorithms that can analyze a set of movies and then recommend new movies to users based on their previous preferences. The projectalso involved the development of a user interface that would allow users to easily browse and select movies. We haveimplemented a content-based filtering algorithm to recommend movies to users. This algorithm takes in a user's preferences as input and then recommends new movies that are like the ones that the user has already watched. Along with that, we have made a Hybrid recommendation system using GPT3 in which movies are going to be recommended based on the hybrid features.
